        <h2>Screen Reader and Technologies </h2>
        <p>
            Screen reader is a type of computer software that read what is on computer to voice.
            Screen readers are used by people with vision proble (e.g. : blindness, vision impairment, etc)
            or people who can process voice better than vision.
